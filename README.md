4. Create a .env file with a dummy secret key
	 echo "SECRET_KEY=dummykey" > .env

5. Create the database
	python manage.py migrate

6. Generate a unique secret key using django's shell and replace dummy file with output
	echo "SECRET_KEY="$(python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())') > .env
