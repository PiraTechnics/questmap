Developer Notes

- Secret_key is exposed by default, this is an issue. Fix as per: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64208678/hiding-secret-key-in-django-project-on-github-after-uploading-project

- NOTE: Django has a tool to generate random secret keys if needed. Run in shell:
	from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())

- We will also need to turn off debug mode in settings.py when ready to move to production (dw about this for now, just make note)

- Whenever we install a new dependency in our venv, make sure to update requirements.txt:
	pip install <whatever>
	pip freeze > requirements.txt

- Uninstalling apps is a pain in the ass. There's a process to follow, to ensure your files and database aren't FUBAR: https://www.delftstack.com/howto/django/django-remove-app/

- Got basic image uploading/display working, tho can only add/remove from admin panel. New 'maps' app added, will pare down notes to be separate app, should be able to see these on their own if possible
- Cleaned up Readme a bit

- Added Location Model, trying to figure out how to set the x and y of the location within the map (likely requires getting the x and y of a mouseclick, within an acceptable range)
 - Will need to start working with Javascript, to get client side stuff


 Likely solution for setting a space for a location (coordinate range, circle):
